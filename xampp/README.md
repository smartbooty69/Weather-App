### Getting Started

Welcome to the Database Management System Lab for the Master of Computer Applications program at St. Joseph’s University. This repository contains a series of SQL and PL/SQL exercises and projects designed to enhance your understanding of Oracle Database concepts, query writing, and procedural programming. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment and begin working on the lab assignments.

#### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Oracle Database:** Download and install [Oracle Database Express Edition (XE)](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/xe.html) for your operating system. This free version provides essential features for learning SQL and PL/SQL.

- **Oracle SQL Developer:** Install [Oracle SQL Developer](https://www.oracle.com/database/sqldeveloper/) to connect to your Oracle Database, execute SQL queries, and manage your database schema easily.

- **Basic Knowledge of SQL and PL/SQL:** Familiarity with SQL commands, PL/SQL syntax, and database concepts will be beneficial for completing the assignments.

#### Cloning the Repository

To get started with the DBMS lab projects, clone the repository to your local machine. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smartbooty69/MCA-2024-2026.git
```

#### Project Structure

The projects are organized into directories based on their topics. Navigate to the **Database Management System** folder to access the individual SQL and PL/SQL assignments. Each project is named sequentially (e.g., `Prog01.sql`, `Prog02.sql`, etc.) and contains the necessary SQL and PL/SQL code to complete the tasks.

#### Running the Projects

1. **Open Oracle SQL Developer:**
   - Launch Oracle SQL Developer from your applications.

2. **Create a New Connection:**
   - Click on the green "+" icon to create a new connection.
   - Enter the connection name, username (default is `SYSTEM` or as per your setup), and password.
   - Select your database from the connection type and test the connection to ensure it works.

3. **Execute the SQL/PLSQL Scripts:**
   - Open the SQL script file (e.g., `Prog01.sql`) in SQL Developer.
   - Highlight the code you wish to execute or select the entire script.
   - Click the "Run Script" button (the one with a sheet of paper icon) or press `F5` to execute the script.

4. **Verify Results:**
   - Use `SELECT` statements to verify that your queries executed correctly and to check the results in your database.
   - View the data in the “Connections” panel under your schema or use the SQL Worksheet to run queries.

#### Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have enhancements or additional assignments, feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests. Ensure to follow best coding practices and comment your SQL code for clarity.
